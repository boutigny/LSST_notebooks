/sps/lsst/users/boutigny/conda_envs/desc_2/lib/python3.8/contextlib.py:120: UserWarning: Creating scratch directories is taking a surprisingly long time. This is often due to running workers on a network file system. Consider specifying a local-directory to point workers to write scratch data to a local disk.
